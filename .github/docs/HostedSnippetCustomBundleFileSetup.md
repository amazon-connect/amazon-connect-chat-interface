# Host Widget Snippet Integrated Custom UI (S3 Bucket/CDN)

## Overview
Integrate a fully customized the chat interface UI in the pre-built Hosted Widget, with all configurations available in the Connect Admin Console. The hosted widget can handle all of the logic to render the widget on your website and start chat sessions.

If your intention is to only customize [amazon-connect-chat-interface.js](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-interface) and use it in your chat widget, you can consider this method as a quick way to do it. If you want to customize [amazon-connect-chat.js](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chatjs), this method is not suitable.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Amazon Connect Instance [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-instances.html)]
  - OR: enable chat experience for an existing Connect instance. [[guide](../README.md#enabling-chat-in-an-existing-amazon-connect-contact-center)]

- Create an Amazon Connect Contact Flow, ready to receive chat contacts. [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat.html)]

    - For demo purposes, you can start with the ["Sample Inbound Flow (First Contact)"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/sample-inbound-flow.html)

1. If you don't already have a Chat Widget instance in your AWS account, please set one up by following this [AWS Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tutorial1-set-up-your-instance.html).

        ```
        amazon_connect('customerChatInterfaceUrl', 'https://...'); // TODO: put in your link to amazon-connect-chat-interface.js
        ```
