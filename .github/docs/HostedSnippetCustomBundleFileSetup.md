# Host Widget Snippet Integrated Custom UI (S3 Bucket/CDN)

## Overview

Fork the open-souce [GitHub Chat Interface](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-interface) and customize your own customer chat UI. Import the custom bundle file into the pre-built [Amazon Connect Hosted Widget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/add-chat-to-website.html). The hosted widget will handle all the backend logic and [StartChatContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartChatContact.html) API requests, allowing you to focus on the UI development.

You'll need to fork the [GitHub Chat Interface](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-interface) and generate a custom bundle file: `amazon-connect-chat-interface.js`

> üìç Please note, [pre-built Hosted Widget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/add-chat-to-website.html) Chat Interface is a different code base than this Github Chat Interface. We try to release the newest feature, but we do not guarantee the latest internal features are available on GitHub. Github Chat Interface is provided as-is, and it's inteded to be a fully-functional boilerplate for an Amazon Connect Chat UI.
