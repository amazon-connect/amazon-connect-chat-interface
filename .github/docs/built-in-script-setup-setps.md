# Use the customized version of amazon-connect-chat-interface.js in a quick way

## Overview
The documentation shows how to access a customized version of `amazon-connect-chat-interface.js` using the Chat Widget script. If your intention is to only customize [amazon-connect-chat-interface.js](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-interface) and use it in your chat widget, you can consider this method as a quick way to do it. If you want to customize [amazon-connect-chat.js](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chatjs), this method is not suitable.

## Setup Guildes
1. If you don't already have a Chat Widget instance in your AWS account, please set one up by following this [AWS Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tutorial1-set-up-your-instance.html).

2. On the Chat Widget Panel, you can see your Chat widget script.
